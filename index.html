					fascination and pleasure for lovers of good food. Beyond being a simple beverage, wine holds in its
					depths a rich history, culture and science that arouses the curiosity of winemakers, sommeliers and
					fans alike.</p>
				<p>In this project, we dive into the exciting world of wine through an exhaustive analysis of data. We
					take on the challenge of unraveling the secrets hidden in a data set obtained from a chemical
					analysis of wines grown in the same region of Italy, but derived from three different grape
					varieties.</p>
				<p>What is the purpose of this project? I have set myself the challenge of exploring this data set with
					the goal of revealing patterns, profiles and correlations between the different chemical components
					present in the wines. From alcohol content to color intensity to acidity and total phenols, each
					attribute offers us a unique window into the sensory complexity of these elixirs.</p>
				<p>But why is this project important? Beyond the mere pleasure of research, data analysis applied to the
					world of wine has profound implications in a number of areas. From improving production processes
					and quality in the wine industry, to discovering consumer trends and market preferences, the
					insights gained can be invaluable to producers, distributors and consumers alike.</p>
				<p>Come with me on this journey of discovery and learning, where you will explore the most fascinating
					corners of winemaking through the eyes of data analysis. Get ready to be surprised, inspired and,
					above all, enjoy a good wine!</p>

				<P>The depths of data analysis have revealed fascinating findings about our precious wines, unraveling
					secrets hidden in each vintage. Through extensive research and rigorous analysis methods, we have
					gained a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between wine attributes. These findings,
					the product of a project on <a
						href="https://github.com/DCajiao/Wine-Clustering-Challenge">GitHub</a>, have allowed us to
					formulate a series of intriguing questions
					that shed light on the unique characteristics of each vintage. From the ten most significant
					correlations between wine attributes to the variety of cultivars used in their production, each
					question
					reveals a different facet of our exciting exploration into the world of wine.</P>
				<hr class="dashed">
				<h2>What are the ten correlations with the highest percentage among wine attributes?</h2>
				<p>Exploring the correlations between different wine attributes gives us a unique insight into how these
					components interact in the composition of each vintage. Through detailed analysis, we have
					identified the top ten correlations, revealing the most significant relationships between aspects
					such as alcohol content, acidity and color intensity. These correlations provide valuable
					information on how certain attributes can influence others, contributing to our understanding of the
					sensory and chemical profile of each wine.</p>

						alt="" /></span>
				<p>As we can see, there are wine characteristics with a very high correlation index. If you are a wine
					expert, this information will be very useful and interesting for you.</p>
				<hr class="dashed">
				<h2>How many wines do we have for each cultivar?</h2>
				<p>In the analysis, we have carefully examined the distribution of wines by the cultivars, breaking down
					the
					number of samples available for each vintage. This detailed count reveals a panoramic view of the
					diversity and abundance in our wine selection. With this information, we can appreciate the richness
					and variety that each vintage brings, offering a wide range of wines to explore and enjoy. From the
					most abundant vintages to the most select, each vintage tells its own story, reflecting the unique
					characteristics of the wines.</p>
				<span class="image main"><img
						src="https://github.com/DCajiao/Wine-Clustering-Challenge/blob/main/graphics/bar/Total%20wines%20per%20Cultivar_bar.png?raw=true"
						alt="" /></span>
				<hr class="dashed">
				<h2>How correlated are the wine characteristics of each crop?</h2>
				<p>Exploring the correlation between the characteristics of each vintage's wine gives us deep insight
					into the intrinsic relationships between the attributes that define its flavor, aroma and
					composition. By meticulously examining these correlations, we can discover patterns and trends that
					uniquely characterize each vintage. This understanding allows us to appreciate how certain wine
					attributes can influence others, and how these relationships can vary from vintage to vintage. From
					the complexity and sophistication of older vintages to the freshness and vitality of more recent
					ones, each vintage reveals its own internal harmony, enriching our appreciation of the art of wine.
				</p>
				<h3>Let's look at the correlations in cultivar 1</h3>
				<span class="image main"><img
						src="https://github.com/DCajiao/Wine-Clustering-Challenge/blob/main/graphics/corr/Wine%20correlations%20on%20the%20cultivar%201.png?raw=true"
						alt="" /></span>
				<h3>Let's look at the correlations in cultivar 2</h3>
				<span class="image main"><img
						src="https://github.com/DCajiao/Wine-Clustering-Challenge/blob/main/graphics/corr/Wine%20correlations%20on%20the%20cultivar%202.png?raw=true"
						alt="" /></span>
				<h3>Let's look at the correlations in cultivar 3</h3>
				<span class="image main"><img
						src="https://github.com/DCajiao/Wine-Clustering-Challenge/blob/main/graphics/corr/Wine%20correlations%20on%20the%20cultivar%203.png?raw=true"
						alt="" /></span>
				<p>When examining the chemical profile of wines produced in different geographic regions, we observe
					notable variations that reflect the distinct characteristics and winemaking practices characteristic
					of each area. Between regions, factors such as soil composition, climate, grape varieties and
					winemaking techniques contribute to unique chemical compositions in wines. For example, wines from
					colder climates may have higher acidity levels due to slower grape ripening, while those from warmer
					regions may exhibit richer fruit flavors and higher alcohol content. In addition, soil types, such
					as chalky or clay, can influence the mineral content of the wine, adding layers of complexity to its
					flavor profile. Winemaking methods, such as fermentation temperature and aging processes, also
					influence chemical composition, contributing specific aromas, tannic structures and color intensity
					to wines. Ultimately, the chemical profile of wines from different geographic regions provides
					insight into the diverse environments and winemaking traditions that contribute to the richness and
					complexity of the global wine landscape.</p>
				<hr class="dashed">
				<h3>In which cultivar is the most intensely colored wine produced?</h3>
				<span class="image main"><img
						src="https://github.com/DCajiao/Wine-Clustering-Challenge/blob/main/graphics/bar/Wine%20Color%20intensity%20of%20each%20cultivar_bar.png?raw=true"
						alt="" /></span>
				<p>Inquiring into the vintage that produces the most intensely colored wine immerses us in the chromatic
					and sensory richness of the different wine varieties. This question leads us to explore beyond the
					surface of the wine, delving into its deep visual nuance. By discovering which vintage stands out
					for its chromatic intensity, we can appreciate how factors such as soil, climate and cultivation
					techniques influence the visual appearance of the wine. It is an invitation to dive into a world of
					rich and vibrant hues, where each vintage has its own story to tell through color.</p>
				<hr class="dashed">
				<h3>Which cultivar produces the wine with the highest alcohol content?</h3>
				<span class="image main"><img
						src="https://github.com/DCajiao/Wine-Clustering-Challenge/blob/main/graphics/bar/Wine%20Alcohol%20content%20of%20each%20cultivar_bar.png?raw=true"
						alt="" /></span>
				<p>The question of which cultivar produces the wine with the highest alcohol content leads us to explore
					the
					particularities of each type of grape and how they influence the final result. Through data
					analysis, we can discover which variety stands out for its high alcohol content, which helps us
					better understand how factors such as climate and growing practices affect the wine. This finding
					gives us an interesting look at how grape ripening and the fermentation process influence the
					properties of the wine we enjoy in each glass.</p>
				<hr class="dashed">
				<h3>In which cultivar is the wine with the greatest sensation of freshness produced?</h3>
				<span class="image main"><img
						src="https://github.com/DCajiao/Wine-Clustering-Challenge/blob/main/graphics/bar/Wine%20Malic%20Acid%20content%20of%20each%20cultivar_bar.png?raw=true"
						alt="" /></span>
				<p>Exploring the vintage that produces the wine with the greatest sensation of freshness takes us into
					the world of wine chemistry. From a chemical point of view, freshness in a wine is closely related
					to the malic acid index. This question invites us to discover which vintage distinguishes itself by
					offering a unique sensory experience of freshness. By identifying this characteristic, we can dive
					into the more subtle and refreshing aspects of wine tasting, exploring how chemical components
					contribute to creating a memorable sensory experience. It is a window into the sophistication of
					flavors and aromas that can emerge from the perfect combination of climate, soil and growing
					techniques.</p>
				<hr class="dashed">
				<h3>In which crop is the healthiest wine produced?</h3>
				<p>The question of which crop produces the healthiest wine leads us to explore the scientific aspects
					behind wine health. From a scientific point of view, wines with a high antioxidant index, including
					flavonoids and proanthocyanidins, are considered the healthiest and most beneficial to the body. By
					identifying which crop excels in producing wines with these properties, we can better understand how
					certain farming practices and soil characteristics influence the chemical composition of the wine
					and thus its health benefits. This discovery offers an intriguing perspective on how grape choice
					and winemaking methods can positively impact our health when we enjoy a glass of wine.</p>
				<span class="image main"><img
						src="https://github.com/DCajiao/Wine-Clustering-Challenge/blob/main/graphics/bar/Wine%20Flavanoids%20content%20of%20each%20cultivar_bar.png?raw=true"
						alt="" /></span>
				<span class="image main"><img
						src="https://github.com/DCajiao/Wine-Clustering-Challenge/blob/main/graphics/bar/Wine%20Proanthocyanins%20content%20of%20each%20cultivar_bar.png?raw=true"
						alt="" /></span>
				<p>So we can conclude that the healthiest wine, i.e., the one with the highest antioxidant content
					indexes, are the wines produced in cultivar 1. </p>
				<hr class="dashed">
				<h2 class="major">Conclusions</h2>
				<h3>What can we say about each crop?</h3>
				<p>When analyzing the results of each crop, we can appreciate different strengths and distinctive
					characteristics in wine production. </p>
				<h4>Cultivar 1:</h4>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/cultivar1.webp" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Cultivar 1 stands out for producing wines with the highest alcohol content, which can be attributed
					to certain climatic conditions or specific growing practices. In addition, this crop presents wines
					that are classified as the healthiest, suggesting a unique combination of antioxidants and other
					compounds beneficial to health. </p>
				<hr>
				<h4>Cultivar 2:</h4>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/cultivar2.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>On the other hand, Cultivar 2 excels in the color intensity of its wines, which may be a result of
					factors such as the type of grape or winemaking techniques employed. Although it does not reach the
					extreme levels of alcohol as Cultivar 1, its wines maintain an adequate balance in this aspect. </p>
				<hr>
				<h4>Cultivar 3:</h4>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/cultivar3.jpg" alt="" /></span>
				<p>Finally, Cultivar 3 is distinguished by the quantity of wines produced, which may indicate a greater
					diversity in the grape varieties grown or winemaking methods used. In addition, although it does not
					lead in terms of alcohol content or color intensity, its wines still offer health benefits,
					reflecting a focus on quality and nutritional composition in wine production. </p>

				<h2 class="major">API Wine Clustering</h2>
				<span class="image main"><img src="images/api.png" alt="API" /></span>
				<h3>How does the Wine Clustering API work?</h3>
				<p>With each request, the Wine Clustering API consumes the google API to obtain the dataset (csv file)
					again in each execution, this is thought so that in case there is an update of data in the online
					csv, the API can consume that new data to process it later... </p>
				<p>Once the data is obtained in real time, the Wine Clustering API loads the content of the dataset to a
					<a href="https://pandas.pydata.org">Pandas</a> dataframe to subsequently run a
					<a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.KMeans.html">KMeans
						model</a> that allows us to classify the wines in 3 different cultivars (why in 3 cultivars?, in
					the <a href="https://github.com/DCajiao/Wine-Clustering-Challenge/tree/API">Github repository</a>,
					you will find more details about the technical and mathematical process that
					was applied to reach this value).
				</p>
				<p>
					Once the wines are classified, the Wine Clustering API performs a labeling of the results obtained
					by the KMeans classification, or in other words, it attaches a label about the origin of that wine:
					Cultivar 1, Cultivar 2 or Cultivar 3? well, thanks to the Wine Clustering API we can know...
				</p>
